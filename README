Hi everyone,

I have decided to make this project open source in hopes that it will continue to grow and become 
useful for more people.

/ColdTurkey   <-- Root-level Main application (writes to hosts file)
/CT_notify    <-- User-level background process to trigger CT_popup when time is up
/CT_popup     <-- User-level program that is the popup displayed when the time is up
/kctrp_srv    <-- Root-level Windows service (lock hosts file) and unblocks user when time is up
